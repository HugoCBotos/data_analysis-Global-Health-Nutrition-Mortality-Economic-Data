Quality of Life Improvement Project 🚀

This is a project under construction aimed at analyzing various factors that influence the quality of life across different countries and regions 🌍. The project leverages public health, economic, and social data to understand how different variables impact life expectancy and overall well-being.

🔨 Project Status

Under Construction: The project is a work in progress. Currently, data is being explored and analyzed, and further steps will be added as insights are gathered.

Key Focus: Exploring relationships between life expectancy and several factors, including income, education, healthcare, and social stability. The project will identify actionable insights that could lead to improvements in quality of life.

📊 Jupyter Notebook Overview

The notebook contains:

Data Loading: Downloads and loads the dataset from KaggleHub 🔽.

Initial Data Exploration: A quick look at the data, including the first few rows and general statistics 🧐.

Imports: Libraries for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn 📚.

Planned Analysis: The project will focus on exploring correlations between health, income, education, and other socio-economic factors to understand their impact on life expectancy and overall quality of life 📈.

Future Steps: Statistical testing, advanced modeling (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models), and potential recommendations for improving life quality based on the findings 🔬.

🚧 Current Work:

Data Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and inspecting data for potential issues like missing values.

Visualization: Preliminary visualizations to explore key trends.

Statistical Analysis: Testing hypotheses on relationships between quality of life indicators.

📍 Dataset Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
Global Health, Nutrition, Mortality, and Economic Data

This dataset includes various factors such as life expectancy, income, education, healthcare access, and more, across different countries and years, offering rich insights into the factors that influence quality of life.
